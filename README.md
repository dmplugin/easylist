Copy this file to any desired location in the project 
The line number 20 of this file contains the following code
```sh
20 $configPath = 'app/config/EasyListConfig.php';
```
Change the path mentioned there to the path of the configuration file of the project. For Laravel projects this would be the path of the .env file.
